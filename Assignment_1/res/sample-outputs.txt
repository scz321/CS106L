These are some sample runs of the program between different pages.
Essentially, the code is printing the ladder (vector<string>) every time
it is dequeued at the top of the while loop. We encourage you to do the same
in your code so that you can compare with this sample output and see if your
code is going towards the high priority links first. The later samples will
be especially useful.

As always, feel free to reach out to us if you want to discuss anything!

don't worry if your ladder is different for this start and end page.
